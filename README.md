## 1. Pastel Site (Minimalist)

```bash
cd pastel-site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## 2. Locker Room (3D Experience)
Immersive 3D basketball locker room built with Three.js. Click lockers to navigate.

```bash
cd locker-room-3d
python3 -m http.server 8001

```

**Controls:** Drag to look around, click lockers to zoom in, ESC to close panels.
