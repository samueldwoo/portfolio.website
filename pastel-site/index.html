                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Sam. I spend my mornings at the gym, my days building robots, and my free time on volleyball courts or trying new restaurants. I'm big on self-growth, genuine connections, and finding joy in the everyday.</p>
                
                <p>Born and raised in the Bay, studied electrical engineering at UCSD, now working on robotics systems at Amazon. I believe in treating everyone with respect, being intentional with my time, and constantly learning. Also a huge foodie - if you need restaurant recs, I got you.</p>

                <h3>Things I Care About</h3>
                <ul class="values-list">
                    <li>Self-growth and intentional living</li>
                    <li>Building genuine connections with people</li>
                    <li>Staying active and healthy</li>
                    <li>Good food and new experiences</li>
                    <li>Reading and journaling</li>
                    <li>Being disciplined and accountable</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Currently</h3>
                <p>Reading: <em>101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think by Brianna Wiest</em></p>
                <p>Listening to: <em>The Zurkie Show podcast</em></p>
                <p>Working on: <em>Building better habits, content creation, and catching up on vlog edits</em></p>

                    <h3>Sports & Staying Active</h3>
                    <p>Grew up playing basketball and baseball, now I'm all about volleyball and golf. I play volleyball every Monday at the work gym (easily the highlight of my week), and I've been learning golf since last year. I love that golf is all about finesse rather than pure athleticism - can't just whack the ball and expect good results.</p>
                    <p class="interest-detail">Currently: Hitting the gym at 6am, running on Strava, and looking forward to Mondays</p>

                    <h3>Food & Restaurants</h3>
                    <p>Huge foodie thanks to my parents introducing me to amazing food growing up. I keep lists of restaurants to try, and when I travel, food is always at the top of my itinerary. You'll find me trying new cafes on weekends and suggesting spots from my list for dinner.</p>
                    <p class="interest-detail">Favorite: Wolf in the Woods (SD), Double Chicken Please (NYC), Arsicault bakery, San Ho Won, Zareen's, Duc Huong</p>

                    <p>Started making day-in-the-life vlogs as a creative outlet and way to document my journey. Between filming, editing, and voiceovers, it's taught me a ton about storytelling and discipline. Also big on reading, journaling, and using a calendar to be more intentional with my time.</p>
                    <p class="interest-detail">Goal: Catch up on my vlog backlog and keep posting simple, authentic content</p>
